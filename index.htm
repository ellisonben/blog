        <h2>Noughts &amp; Crosses (aka Tic-Tac-Toe)</h2>
        <p>
            I have put together a JavaScript version of noughts and crosses. It is currently for two human players and I hope to introduce AI functionality soon.

        <h2>Using Canvas</h2>
        <p>
            Experimenting with Canvas has given me a new way to play with the graphical capabilities of the browser.
        </p>
        <canvas id="shapes" width="600" height="170"></canvas>
        <p>
            Here are a selection of stars with differing numbers of points. They are constructed using the quadraticCurveTo method on the context using the parametric equation of a circle to find point on the outside of the circle at equal distances around the circumference.
        </p>
        <canvas id="stars" width="600" height="120"></canvas>
        <p>
            I have also written a function that can draw spirals by drawing straight lines between points on a parametrically defined spiral. In order to make the spiral smoother, one must increase the numberOfLines parameter, particularly if there are a larger number of whirls as this will make the curvature more severe.
        </p>
        
<pre><code>        
function drawSpiral(context, position, size, whirls, numberOfLines) {
    var x = position.x;
    var y = position.y;
    var angle = 0;
    var totalAngle = whirls * 2 * Math.PI;
    var scale = size / (2 * Math.sqrt(
                        Math.pow(totalAngle * Math.cos(totalAngle), 2) + 
                        Math.pow(totalAngle * Math.sin(totalAngle), 2)
                        ));
    context.beginPath();
    context.moveTo(x + size/2, y + size/2);
    for (var i = 0; i < numberOfLines; i++) {
        angle += totalAngle/numberOfLines
        context.lineTo(
                        x + size/2 + scale * angle * Math.cos(angle), 
                        y + size/2 + scale * angle * Math.sin(angle)
                        );
    }
    context.stroke();
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            The key to the function fitting within the assigned size limit is using a scale variable to make sure that the spiral has, at its furthest point, a radius equal to half of the size parameter passed to it. The scale is key to allowing the spiral to be resized.

        <h2>Mouse Trail</h2>

            That is, apart from our old friend the mouse trail. For those of you two young to remember, the mouse trail was the kind of feature only the coolest webpages allowed. Well, nostalgia lovers, I now give you the option to jump in the time machine and enjoy your very own mouse trail.

        <h2>Linux Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>
            So, I shut down from Linux and went to bed after running some updates from the software manager. Next morning I get up and power up my computer expecting the GRUB boot loader where I choose whether to boot into Ubuntu or Windows. BUT, it doesn't appear! Windows just boots straight up. There must be some mistake, I say to myself. Maybe I missed it, although the default is Ubuntu. Reload. Same. Reload. Same. Oh dear.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I consult google to ask what to do. It comes back with Boot Repair. So I boot Ubuntu from my USB and follow the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair">standard instructions</a> to install and run boot repair. Restart (with baited breath). 
        </p>
        <p>   
            Much to my chagrin, it doesn't really do anything. Several hours later I have finally got the GRUB menu to display after going into BIOS, researching bcdedit, EFI and bootmgr amongst other things and have finally come up with a working solution that feels a bit hacky, although I am still unsure how exactly this problem was caused in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            I suppose the learning point is that the inter-relation of so many different pieces of software inevitably causes bugs or, at least, unexpected consequences. When I was first getting started on my computer learning odyssey I was pleased with the order that could be created inside my toy programs, but now I am coming to realise that the computer as a whole is a mind-bendingly complex beast, with so many interactions between so many pieces of software and hardware that there are almost bound to be so-called 'ghosts in the machine' cropping up now and then. Perhaps there is a simple reason that caused the GRUB menu to disappear but it is not widely shared on community forums if it is.

        <h2>Project Euler is great</h2>
        <p>
            When I was reflecting on my learning so far, I realised that much of my progress had been achieved through the process of rote learning. Whilst, from a pedagogical perspective, this approach can have some merits, I found myself feeling that the best way forward from here would be to start setting myself challenges that were less procedural and would require reflection on how best to utilise my existing skillset to come up with an effective approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is an excellent resource for honing your computational and mathematical skills through problem solving. The Project Euler problems are great for this and have proved to be challenging and enjoyable in equal measure. I have been using Python for the majority of my solutions - it has been great to combine my love of solving mathematical problems with coding. I have learnt a lot more about python, utilising a wide variety of modules such as itertools and bitarray to help in specific circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst I am not supposed to share solutions to problems, I thought I could put up a helpful tool that may help those that are beginning to play around with the problem: a prime finder! This one uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Erastosthenes</a> - it's an oldie but a goodie. There are a variety of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068372/fastest-way-to-list-all-primes-below-n">other solutions</a> available and many more efficient packages but it is quite satisfying putting your own sieve together. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram">Sieve of Sundaram</a> is a good next sieve to look at if you are interested in prime sieves.
        </p>
<pre><code>
from math import sqrt
from bitarray import bitarray

def generate_primes(n):
    
    """generate_primes(n)[i] == whether i is prime, given i <= n"""
    
    prime_list = bitarray(n+1)
    prime_list.setall(True)
    prime_list[0] = False
    prime_list[1] = False 
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if prime_list[i] == True:
            x = 0
            while i**2 + x*i <= n:
                prime_list[i**2 + x*i] = False
                x += 1 
    return prime_list

if __name__ == "__main__":
    primes = generate_primes(10**9)
    f = open("primes.txt", "w+b")
    f.write(primes.tobytes())
    f.close()
</code></pre>
        <p>
            To read your primes.txt file back into your python program use the reader below to generate an array. This will save you lots of time, allowing more efficient solutions to many of the problems. It will also save your computer fan a lot of work and lead to a longer living processor. You're Welcome!
        </p>
<pre><code>
from bitarray import bitarray

def read_primes():
    f = open("primes.txt", "r+b")
    primes_bytes = f.read()
    f.close()
    primes = bitarray()
    primes.frombytes(primes_bytes)
    
    return primes
</code></pre>
        <p>   
            Whilst I am not quite at the point where I am able to solve the top difficulty puzzles just yet, I have solved 68 so far, which puts me in the top 3.4% of all problem solvers - aiming to get to become a one percenter soon!

        <h2>Learn Python and C the Hard Way</h2>
        <p>
            After getting my feet wet with the codecademy tutorials, I have now decided to start getting busy in the terminal. I have installed Ubuntu onto my computer and am now getting used to package managing, version control and navigating my computer through the command line. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To guide me on my way with this, I have begun using the resources at <a href="https://learncodethehardway.org/python/">Learn Python the Hard Way<a> and <a href="https://learncodethehardway.org/c/">Learn C the Hard Way<a>, both of which have provided me with insight into areas of the computer I was not previously aware of. These two courses have been really helpful in getting me started using these two programming languages. 
        </p>
        <p>
<pre><code>
from game_functions import *

game_map = Map('room_one')
game = Engine(game_map)
game.play()
</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Above is the main file for my python riddle game that runs in the command line. Below are the classes that are imported into the game in order to allow it to run. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This exercise was particularly interesting for me as I was able to gain greater insight into how I could get class instances to interact with each other and how the class methods could be used to do things that were not entirely trivial, as had been the case in many of the codecademy tutorials.

        <h2>Codecademy is a useful starting point</h2>
        <p>
             One of the first things that I have done in my quest to learn programming is try to identify as many high-quality, free resources as possible. <a href="">Codecademy</a> has been one such resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            It provides good tutorials for helping beginners get to grips with basic programming concepts such as control flow and provides coverage of a variety of languages. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have now completed tutorials in a whole host of languages including Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Git, SQL, Ruby and Java. One of the key things that one realises is that much of the synctatic structure of the languages is very similar and, in many respects, they are essentially dialects of one another. Conceptualising them in this way has allowed me to become increasingly confident at applying my skills at new areas with greater speed and accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of the tutorials offered by codecademy, I would say that the Python and Javascript courses were the most developed in terms of their content and would be the ones that I recommend for new users of the site. Learning to use version control programs like Git is best picked up through incorporating it into your execution of other projects.
